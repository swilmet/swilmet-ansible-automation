# Problem:
# When a process does a lot of I/O operations, other processes on my desktop
# are less responsive, so the whole computer becomes "slow".
#
# Solution:
# Set the BFQ I/O scheduler as the default.
#
# In the Linux source code, see the files:
# - Documentation/block/switching-sched.txt
# - Documentation/block/bfq-iosched.txt
#
# One way to configure BFQ as the default is to set the elevator kernel command
# line option, but it's more complicated because it requires to *modify* a file
# (related to GRUB).
#
# It's easier with udev, because it's a simple file drop, as explained here:
# https://bfq.teambelgium.net/
#
# See also:
# https://fedoramagazine.org/check-storage-performance-with-dd/
# for SSD vs rotational disks (towards the end of the article).
#
# A reboot is needed to apply the change.
- name: set the BFQ I/O scheduler as the default for all disks
