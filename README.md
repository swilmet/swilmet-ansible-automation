swilmet-ansible-automation
==========================

A selection of my [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles that might be
useful to other people.

The names of the roles all start with "swaa" (for swilmet-ansible-automation),
followed by a Linux distribution name, or a family of Linux distributions, or
"generic" if the role applies more broadly.
